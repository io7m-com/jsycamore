    <Paragraph>
      <Term type="term">Components</Term>
      are the elements that make up the user interface inside
      <Link target="cb46abcd-d0b1-41f4-bb95-662186d4aa78">windows</Link>. Concretely, a component is any object that
      implements the
      <Term type="class">SyComponentType</Term>
      interface. The package provides the abstract <Term type="class">SyComponentAbstract</Term> class that provides
      sensible default implementations of all the required methods.

  <Subsection title="Tree">
    <Paragraph>
      Components form a tree structure, with each component having an arbitrary number of child components, and at most
      one parent component. A component is said to be
      <Term type="term">detached</Term>
      if it has no parent component, and it is also not the <Term type="term">root component</Term> for a window. A
      detached component is not visited during
      <Link target="88d61172-40fe-4f21-b4e9-776ff4a8f0d7">layout</Link>
      operations or during
      <Link target="b097067b-b8d6-4397-bb24-6a48f003e84f">event dispatch</Link>.

    <Paragraph>
      A component may be <Term type="term">active</Term> or <Term type="term">inactive</Term>. A component can be set to
      active or inactive by setting the value of the component's
      <Term type="variable">activity</Term>
      attribute. Inactivity is implicitly inherited; if the parent component <Term type="variable">P</Term> of a
      component
      <Term type="variable">C</Term>
      is inactive, then <Term type="variable">C</Term> is considered to be inactive.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      An inactive component will <Term type="term">not</Term> receive events during
      <Link target="b097067b-b8d6-4397-bb24-6a48f003e84f">event dispatch</Link>. Additionally,
      <Link target="6aeefd35-8837-4503-99ee-3ccba984a49e">themes</Link>
      are encouraged to render inactive components in a greyed-out form. For example, the button labelled "Button 1" in
      the following image is inactive and so cannot be clicked:
    </Paragraph>
    <FormalItem title="Inactive Button">
      <Image source="buttonInactive.png"
             width="220"
             height="120">
        Multiple buttons, one of which is inactive.
      </Image>
